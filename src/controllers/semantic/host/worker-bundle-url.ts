 * builds; Pythia ADR-126). The bundle is the same one inlined in main.js
 * (`getEmbeddingBundle`), so the worker and the iframe never diverge — with the
 * Worker prelude in front of it, as for the blob Worker (#306).
 *
 * Memoize the returned promise at the call site: writing the file is idempotent
