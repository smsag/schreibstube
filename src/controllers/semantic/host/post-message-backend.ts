// The protocol both embedding backends speak, in one place (Pythia ADR-204, #365).
//
// A Web Worker and a same-origin iframe are two ways to get the model off the
// plugin's own context, and Pythia talks to both the same way: mount it, prove it
// ready with a ping round-trip, then `texts[] → vectors[]` over postMessage, with
// every deadline measured on the visible clock (Pythia ADR-202). Only the mounting and
// the teardown differ — and whether inference lands off the UI thread.
//
// It was written twice. #363 (a model that finished loading into a provider
// nobody owned) had to be fixed identically in both copies, which is what this
// file is for: a protocol implemented twice drifts, and the copy that drifts is
// the iframe one, because no unit test can reach it — it needs a real Obsidian
// window. A bug fixed here is fixed in both.
