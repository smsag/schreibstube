 * runtime fails to become ready, it transparently falls back to the iframe — so
 * embedding always works, just on the UI thread (kept responsive by the
 * cooperative-yield throttling in VaultIndexService) when the worker is unavailable.
 *
 * Implements EmbeddingProvider itself so callers (ConversationIndexService /
 * VaultIndexService) are unaware of which backend is live.
