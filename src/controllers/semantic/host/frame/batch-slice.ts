/**
 * Cut a batched pipeline result into `count` vectors of equal width.
 *
 * `dims` is the tensor shape — `[batch, dim]` for a pooled batch, and possibly
 * `[dim]` or `[1, dim]` for a single input, so the width is read off the tail
 * either way.
 *
 * Throws when the result is too short for the batch. Slicing past the end
 * silently yields zero-length vectors, which survive quantization and only fail
 * at `serializeIndex` as `chunk dim 0 != 384` — an error naming neither the
 * batch nor the model.
