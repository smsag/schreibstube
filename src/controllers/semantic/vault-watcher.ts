/**
 * Keeping the vault index fresh (Pythia ADR-121), lifted out of `main.ts`
 * (engineering-review #366).
 *
 * The watcher is EVENT-DRIVEN and targeted: an edit re-embeds that one note
 * instead of rescanning the corpus. Changed and deleted paths are batched and
 * flushed on a debounce, so a burst of edits — a sync landing twenty files, a
 * find-and-replace across a folder — coalesces into one `applyChanges`.
 *
 * The batching is the part with rules, so it lives in `VaultChangeBatch`, free of
 * Obsidian and unit-tested: a path is in exactly one of the two sets, the last
 * event about it wins, and a rename is a delete of the old path plus a change of
 * the new one. Getting that wrong is silent — the index keeps serving a note that
 * no longer exists, or forgets one that does — which is exactly the shape of bug
 * `main.ts`'s exclusion from coverage was hiding.
 *
 * The note being written is held back (Pythia ADR-220). Every autosave is a `modify`,
 * so a note someone is typing in used to be re-embedded — and the whole index
 * rewritten — every couple of seconds, on a phone right next to the editor, and
 * that is what reloaded Obsidian mid-sentence. It now reaches the index when the
 * writer leaves it, or once they have stopped for `VAULT_HOLD_IDLE_MS`.
