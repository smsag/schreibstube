// Which rows of a shared index a device may reuse (Pythia ADR-201).
//
// Pythia ADR-200 names index files by VECTOR FAMILY, so a phone on the Latin-script
// variant and a desktop on the full multilingual model read and write the same
// file. That is exact for Latin-script text — the variant's vectors are the full
// model's there — and only there. A note or conversation that contains a
// Cyrillic, Greek or CJK word is embedded differently by the variant (those words
// fall back to single characters). Keyed by content hash alone, such a row looked
// "unchanged" to the other device and was reused forever: the desktop ranked it
// with the phone's degraded vector until the text happened to change.
//
// So a row records, through its hash, whether it could differ from the family's:
//  - a variant writes `<hash>~<tag>` for text it cannot reproduce exactly, and the
//    plain hash for text it can (those rows really are interchangeable);
//  - the full model accepts only the plain hash, so it re-embeds a tagged row;
//  - the variant accepts the plain hash too — the full model's vector is the better
//    one, and refusing it would make the two devices overwrite each other forever.
//
// The index format is unchanged: the tag lives inside the hash string both
// services already compare, so an existing file stays valid.
