// The once-per-session catch-up of a complete vault index (Pythia ADR-221).
//
// The watcher only sees what changes while Pythia runs, and `decideBuild` never
// rescans a complete index. So a note edited on a phone that no longer writes the
// index, a sync that landed before launch, or a note deleted on another device
// kept its old vectors here until it happened to be edited on this device. A
// desktop on a Worker backend caught up by accident — its first send of a session
// ran an incremental sync — but a desktop on the UI-thread fallback (Pythia D-38) served
// the file as it was, and neither caught up before the first question.
//
// The catch-up reads and hashes every in-scope note and embeds only the ones whose
// content moved; the model loads only if one did, and the file is written only if
// something changed. Lifted out of `VaultRagService` so its order of steps is
// tested here and the service stays under its size budget.
