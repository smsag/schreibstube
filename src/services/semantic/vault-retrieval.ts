// Pure retrieval logic for vault-wide semantic RAG (Pythia ADR-116).
//
// Two pieces, both pure and runtime-free so they are fully unit-testable:
//   • noteEmbedChunks — split a note's markdown into the text chunks that get
//     embedded (heading-aware, then windowed to a char budget), mirroring how
//     conversationChunks feeds the conversation index.
//   • retrievalQuery — the text actually embedded for a turn (Pythia ADR-183).
//   • isIndexingOptedOut — the per-note `pythia: false` escape hatch (Pythia ADR-183).
//
// Scoring lives in `VaultIndexService.query`, which yields cooperatively over a
// large index. A second, non-yielding copy (`rankByQuery`) existed here until
// Pythia ADR-183 and had already drifted — it never learned about `exclude`.
