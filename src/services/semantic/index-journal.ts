// The vault index's journal (Pythia ADR-222, closes Pythia D-35).
//
// The index was one serialized array, so every write rewrote all of it — about
// 19 MB at the 5 000-note cap — whether one note had changed or a thousand. That
// is why crash-safe flushing had to be rate-limited (Pythia ADR-182), why a phone typing
// next to a loaded model reloaded (Pythia ADR-220), and why each edit was a 19 MB sync
// event on every device.
//
// The journal is the rows that changed since the index file (the "base") was
// written: re-embedded or added rows, and the ids dropped. It uses the index's own
// format, and is tied to its base by the base's `writtenAt`. An edit rewrites the
// journal (kilobytes). The base is rewritten only by a full sync, a takeover, or
// once the journal has grown past `shouldCompact`, which folds it back in.
//
// A journal whose base is not the one on disk is ignored. That happens after a
// compaction (the old journal lingers until the next edit overwrites it) or when a
// sync delivers the two files out of order. Its notes then answer from the base's
// older vectors until the content hash re-embeds them at the next sync or edit: a
// stale answer, never a wrong row.
//
// Rewritten whole rather than appended: `appendBinary` needs Obsidian 1.12.3, the
// manifest promises 1.4.0, and a file this small costs nothing to rewrite.
