// Whether a vault-index build may start, and what it must reset first (Pythia ADR-203).
//
// The head of `VaultRagService.refresh` had grown into six interacting flags —
// force, manual, clear, a complete index, the crash-loop guard and a previous
// failure — and two bugs were living in exactly that tangle (#358, #359). It is
// a decision, not an effect, so it is made here and tested as a table.
//
// The rule that is new: an AUTOMATIC build does not retry a load that already
// failed in this session. `FallbackEmbeddingProvider` memoizes its rejection
// (deliberately — an out-of-memory load must not be hammered), so every send
// after a failed load re-entered the build, failed in a millisecond, and left
// another interrupted-build marker behind. Two sends after ONE out-of-memory
// load were enough to report "the last 2 builds ended without finishing" and
// pause a build that had only ever failed once. Only a manual build — which
// unloads the provider first — or a new session can clear it.
