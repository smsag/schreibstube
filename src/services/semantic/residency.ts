// When the embedding model stays in memory on a phone (Pythia ADR-202).
//
// After a build the loaded model holds ~400 MB of Obsidian's web process whether
// anything is being embedded or not. iOS ends backgrounded apps largest-first to
// reclaim memory, so an idle model is what gets Obsidian thrown out when the user
// opens the camera — and a thrown-out app cold-starts on return, which looks
// exactly like the "hard reload" this work began with. On a phone the model is
// therefore released when Obsidian goes to the background and after
// IDLE_RELEASE_MS without use, and loaded again ahead of need: when Obsidian
// comes back, and when the user focuses the chat input. Reloading from the cache
// took 0.7 s on the reporter's iPhone, so typing a question hides it.
//
// The desktop is untouched: nothing is released there.
//
// This module also owns the ONE `visibilitychange` reaction Pythia has: the
// visible clock (timeouts), the build guard (background deaths) and the release.
