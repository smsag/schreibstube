# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## 1.0.1 - 2026-06-02

### Changed

- Restored deterministic stack-only headline overlay behavior in Live Edit.
- Removed hover and sibling expansion behavior; click/tap now navigates directly.
- Aligned overlay host mounting with the original Headway implementation for reliable Live Edit rendering.
- Improved iOS behavior with safe-area notch padding for the top stack row.
- Updated local docs for current stack-only behavior and release flow.

### Fixes

- Fixed cases where no heading stack appeared in Live Edit after reopening/re-activating the plugin.
- Fixed iOS regressions causing stuck/flickering scroll behavior.

### Release

- BRAT-ready release artifacts: `main.js`, `manifest.json`, `styles.css`.

## 1.0.0 - 2026-06-02

### Changed

- Repository hardened for distribution with docs excluded from Git tracking.

### Release

- First stable public release for BRAT installation.
